We make great efforts to maintain an active, positive, friendly and inclusive community around Lance and game development.

### Starting out

To get a bird's eye view on what's Lance all about and how to use it to make a multiplayer game, we recommend reading the guide: {@tutorial architecture}

If you're more of the learning-by-doing type, you can start with the first tutorial, {@tutorial MyFirstGame} which contains step-by-step instructions on how to implement a networked version of this classic game.

### Joining the discussion
You're welcome to join the [Lance Slack](http://slack.lance.gg) to hang out and engage in active discussion with the project maintainers and fellow game developers.

### Keeping in touch

Follow [LanceGG_](http://twitter.com/LanceGG_) on Twitter to hear the latest and see what others are doing with Lance

### Getting help
Feel free to ask anything on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lance). We keep an eye out for questions!

### Helping out

Lance is an open source project, and as such we welcome any contribution.

 * Spreading the word, posting or tweeting about Lance in social media using the (https://twitter.com/lancegg_)[@lancegg_ tag]. The larger the community, the more fun we have and the faster development can move!

 * Improving the documentation: fixing typos, expanding, clarifying or writing new articles

 * Fixing bugs, or adding new functionality. A good place to start would be issues on Github with a status of **["PR Welcome"](https://github.com/lance-gg/lance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22)**. Make sure to open pull requests against the develop branch.
